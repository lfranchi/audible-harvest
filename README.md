Monitor all your social networks for music activity, find out what your friends are listening to, and who listened to it first.

## Disclaimer

Yo, this is in serious development right now. Music Hack Day ends on the evening of February 12th. Don't expect anything to work until then.

## Parts

- `extension/` contains a Chrome extension for monitoring Facebook and Twitter streams.
- `server/` contains a Sinatra server for spidering links and aggregating stats.

## Usage

- Good luck!
